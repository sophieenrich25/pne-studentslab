The error is located in the line 10. It type is ZeroDivisionError, this occurs when this
values for result 2 are chosen (a=0, b=2, c=3, d=3). t1 is equal 0 (c-d = 0;3-3=0), therefore
when we execute t3 it is impossible because we can't divide by 0.

In order to solve the error it will be enough with avoiding that t1 result is equal 0, for that
the values of c and d must be different.
